# Bharat Intern

Welcome, This README provides an overview of the tasks during your internship. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to your supervisor or mentor.

Tasks Overview:
SMS Classifier:

Description: Develop a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam).
Goals: Achieve high accuracy in classifying SMS messages to help identify and filter out spam messages effectively.
Approach: Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to train the model on a dataset of labeled SMS messages.
Titanic Survival Prediction:

Description: Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic.
Goals: Predict survival outcomes based on passenger attributes such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare.
Approach: Use supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to train the model on the Titanic dataset, considering feature engineering and model evaluation techniques.
Dog vs. Cat Classifier:

Description: Develop a deep learning model to classify images of dogs and cats.
Goals: Create a model capable of accurately distinguishing between images of dogs and cats.
Approach: Implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to train the model on a dataset of labeled dog and cat images, focusing on data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
Repository Structure:
sms_classifier/: Contains code, datasets, and documentation related to the SMS classifier task.
titanic_survival/: Includes code, datasets, and documentation for the Titanic survival prediction task.
dog_vs_cat_classifier/: Houses code, datasets, and documentation for the dog vs. cat classifier task.
